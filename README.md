Foreground Simulation Suite Plus for the 21 cm Reionization Signal Detection
=============================================================

The `Fg21Sim+` is a simulation suite in the radio domain aiming to offer a 
high resolution, high fidelity modeling of the various foregrounds for the 
21 cm signal detection. 

This is the next-gen version of our `fg21sim` low frequency radio simulator.
We build the `Fg21Sim+` to generate a full sky simulation map for radio 
facilities like BINGO, MWA, and SKA. 

Dev Status
--------
The `Fg21Sim+` pacakge is under heavy developemnts. You can use the stable
[`fg21sim`](https://github.com/Fg21Sim/fg21sim) for now.
