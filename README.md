# Fg21SimPlus

Foreground Simulation Suite Plus for the 21 cm Reionization Signal Detection
=============================================================

The Fg21Sim+ is a simulation suite in the radio domain aiming to offer a 
high resolution, high fidelity modeling of the various foregrounds for the 
21 cm signal detection. 

This is the next-gen version of our fg21sim low frequency radio simulator.
We build the Fg21Sim+ to generate a full sky simulation map for radio 
facilities like BINGO, MWA, and SKA.
